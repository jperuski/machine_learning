## Machine Learning Code
Coding machine learning algorithms from scratch. These are algorithmic templates for useful methods.

### Centroids 
1. Kmeans - via Lloyd's method
2. Kmeans++ - via Lloyd's method
### Tensorflow Sandbox
1. conda seteup
2. Linear regression examples for API exploration
3. Logistic regression experimtents
